# Getting Started with Avalanche Connector

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

We then installed `@avalabs/avalanche-connector`. After that you can open src -> context -> web3Connection.context.tsx

This is meant to be the simplest example as possible and thus only deals with connecting dApps to the Avalanche extension. If you
are using a later version of `@web3-react/core` than `@web3-react/core@8.0.17-beta.0`

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.\
You will also see any lint errors in the console.
